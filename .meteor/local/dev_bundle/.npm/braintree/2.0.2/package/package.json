All organizations that handle credit card information are required to comply with this standard. As part of this obligation, Braintree is updating its services to require TLS 1.2 for all HTTPS connections. Braintree will also require HTTP/1.1 for all connections. Please see our [technical documentation](https://github.com/paypal/tls-update) for more information.**\n\n## Installation\n\n* `npm install braintree`\n* `var braintree = require('braintree')`\n\n### Dependencies\n\n* node >= 4\n\n## Links\n\n* [Documentation](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/node/sdk/server/overview)\n* [Bug Tracker](http://github.com/braintree/braintree_node/issues)\n\n## Quick Start\n```javascript\nvar braintree = require('braintree');\n\nvar gateway = braintree.connect({\n  environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,\n  merchantId: 'your_merchant_id',\n  publicKey: 'your_public_key',\n  privateKey: 'your_private_key'\n});\n\ngateway.transaction.sale({\n  amount: '5.00',\n  paymentMethodNonce: 'nonce-from-the-client',\n  options: {\n    submitForSettlement: true\n  }\n}, function (err, result) {\n  if (err) {\n    console.error(err);\n    return;\n  }\n\n  if (result.success) {\n    console.log('Transaction ID: ' + result.transaction.id);\n  } else {\n    console.error(result.message);\n  }\n});\n```\n## Tests\n\nThe unit specs can be run by anyone on any system, but the integration specs are meant to be run against a local development server of our gateway code. These integration specs are not meant for public consumption and will likely fail if run on your system. To run unit tests use rake (`rake test:unit`) or npm (`npm test`).\n\n## License\n\nSee the LICENSE file.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/braintree/braintree_node/issues"},"_id":"braintree@2.0.2","_shasum":"3c898c40404969f34d31e158fe0b17c09d7955f5","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/braintree/-/braintree-2.0.2.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/braintree/-/braintree-2.0.2.tgz"}
