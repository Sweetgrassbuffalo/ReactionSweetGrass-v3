It is intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. Designed mostly for iOS, but also works great on latest Android, Windows Phone 8 and modern Desktop browsers\n\nSwiper is not compatible with all platforms, it is a modern touch slider which is focused only on modern apps/platforms to bring the best experience and simplicity.\n\n# Getting Started\n  * [Getting Started Guide](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/get-started/)\n  * [API](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/api/)\n  * [Demos](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/demos/)\n  * [Forum](http://www.idangero.us/swiper/forum/)\n\n# Dist / Build\n\nOn production use files (JS and CSS) only from `dist/` folder, there will be the most stable versions, `build/` folder is only for development purpose\n\n### Build\n\nSwiper uses `gulp` to build a development (build) and dist versions.\n\nFirst you need to have `gulp-cli` which you should install globally.\n\n```\n$ npm install --global gulp\n```\n\nThen install all dependencies, in repo's root:\n\n```\n$ npm install\n```\n\nAnd build development version of Swiper:\n```\n$ gulp build\n```\n\nThe result is available in `build/` folder.\n\n### Dist/Release\n\nAfter you have made build:\n\n```\n$ gulp dist\n```\n\nDistributable version will available in `dist/` folder.\n\n# Contributing\n\nAll changes should be committed to `src/` files. Swiper uses LESS for CSS compliations, and concatenated JS files (look at gulpfile.js for concat files order)\n\nSwiper 2.x.x\n==========\n\nIf you still using Swiper 2.x.x or you need old browsers support, you may find it in [Swiper2 Branch](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/tree/Swiper2)\n* [Download Latest Swiper 2.7.6](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/archive/v2.7.6.zip)\n* [Source Files](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/tree/Swiper2/src)\n* [API](https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper/blob/Swiper2/API.md)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"swiper@3.4.2","_shasum":"39d6b410b1a39833e1f72d3b72999df5f5e38392","_resolved":"https://registry.npmjs.org/swiper/-/swiper-3.4.2.tgz","_from":"https://registry.npmjs.org/swiper/-/swiper-3.4.2.tgz"}
